    </header>

    <p>There is actually not much to say about me and my work, as life is a matter of constant change. What I am right now might have nothing to do with the person I will become a few days from now. Sounds philosophical? Maybe. The most constant thing about the work I am doing is that I am not (only) here for the money. I am here for the constant change and progess all tech stuff is making. I want to be on the bleeding edge, learn new stuff and bring solutions into production. <strong>Tech is moving fast and I want to keep up</strong>.</p>
